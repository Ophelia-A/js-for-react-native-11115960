 ### ASSSIGNMENT SUMMARY
The assignment entailed tasks which required functions to be created and executed. The tasks include creating arrayManipulation.js, declaring the processArray function to make changes on some numbers based on two conditions, adding formatArrayStrings to modify strings based on the numbers processed by the processArray function, and creating userInfo.js with createUserProfiles generating user profiles with original and modified names.
### TASK 1:
In task 1, the JavaScript file "arrayManipulation.js" is created. The function "processArray" is created and it takes an array of numerical values as an input and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.
### TASK 2:
In task 2, the function "formatArrayStrings" is added to the JavaScript file "arrayManipulation.js." The function takes an array of string values as an input and the array of numbers processed by the "processArray" function. The function modifies each string based on its corresponding number. The entire string is capitalized if its corresponding number is even and converted to lower case if its corresponding number is odd.
### TASK 3: 
In task 3, another file "userInfo.js" is created and within it is the function "createUserProfiles" that takes an array of user names as an input and the modified names from task 2. It then returns an array of objects which contain the originalName, modifiedName and id.
